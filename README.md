## warning
**I am bad at rust, and couldn't avoid mixing asynchronous and synchronous code, what this means is DON'T spam the run button**

if I understand things correctly it will run a bunch of times and that is bad, it's essentially spamming at steams servers

if I don't understand things correctly that's probably even worse.

here is the steam web api terms of service https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apiterms

**do not issue a steam key unless you know and understand these terms of service.**
